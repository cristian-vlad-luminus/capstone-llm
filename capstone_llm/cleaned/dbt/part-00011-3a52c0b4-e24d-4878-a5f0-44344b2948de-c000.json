{"title":"How to run multi-tag selector","question_body":"<p>I am using dbt 0.18.1 and I follow the documentation about tags however I am curious to know how to run multi-tag selector as arguments.\nAccording to this:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/1014\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/1014</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Select using a mix of tags, fqns, and parent/child selectors:\n$ dbt run --model tag:nightly+ salesforce.*+</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately this is not really a &quot;mix of tags&quot;. <br/><br/>\nI have tags of [mixpanel_tests, quality] and I wish to run models that have both tags included (not separated). If I run <code>dbt run -m tag:quality -t blabla</code></p>\n<ol>\n<li>I would have executed all models that have QUALITY in the array of tags regardless if its single argument or multiple argument however I wish to run ONLY quality marked. How to do that?</li>\n<li>How do I specify 2 tags or 3 tags selector to run models with the mentioned tags (i.e mixpanel_tests, quality - but only those models that have both tags defined). More or less an AND clause rather than an OR clause.\n<br/>\nHmm I hope it is clear. How to have multitag selector that executes only the combination of tags given?</li>\n</ol>\n","answer_body":"<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/set-operators/#intersections\" rel=\"noreferrer\">intersection operator</a>. It's new in dbt v0.18, and it's for this use case exactly.</p>\n<pre><code>dbt run -m tag:mixpanel_tests,tag:quality\n</code></pre>\n"}
