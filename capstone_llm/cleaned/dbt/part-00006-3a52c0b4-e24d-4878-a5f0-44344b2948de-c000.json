As you can see on the image bellow, there is usually 1 to 2 transformations before to have our final table (up to 5 transformations in some cases).</p>\n<p>What I am trying to achieve is to do dbt run only for a set on linked model. For instance, <code>sales_prediction</code> and <code>forecast</code>.
