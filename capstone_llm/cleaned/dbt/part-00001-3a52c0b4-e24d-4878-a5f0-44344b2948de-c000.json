{"title":"Only run a set of models?","question_body":"<p>I started to migrate some of your transformations jobs to DBT. As you can see on the image bellow, there is usually 1 to 2 transformations before to have our final table (up to 5 transformations in some cases).</p>\n<p>What I am trying to achieve is to do dbt run only for a set on linked model. For instance, <code>sales_prediction</code> and <code>forecast</code>.  I am currently able to run either for everything with <code>dbt run o</code>r just speficif model using <code>dbt run --select model_name</code></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/s4jl5.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/s4jl5.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n","answer_body":"<p>Dbt allows syntax of</p>\n<ul>\n<li>selecting a node <em>and all nodes it requires</em> (<code>+</code> before the model name)</li>\n<li>selecting a node <em>and all nodes that depend on it</em> (<code>+</code> after the model name)</li>\n<li>you can also do both (<code>+model_name+</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In your case <code>dbt run --select +forecast</code> should do the trick</p>\n<p>Also check the <a href=\"https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/graph-operators#the-plus-operator\" rel=\"noreferrer\">documentation of <em>the <code>+</code> operator</em></a>.</p>\n"}
